name: hello-world
description: Greet the user and offer to help with their project
---

Greet the user warmly. Mention the name of the project directory you're working in.

If $ARGUMENTS is provided, treat it as the user's name and address them personally.

After greeting, briefly offer 2-3 things you could help with based on the project context (e.g., exploring the codebase, fixing a bug, writing tests).

Keep the greeting short — no more than a few sentences.
